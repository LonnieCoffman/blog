I started attending [Launch School](http://launchschool.com) a little over a month ago and since I am a long time Windows user I quickly discovered that setting up a development environment for programming in Ruby was not an easy thing to do.  After doing a bit of research I found that I really only had a couple of options.

**1. Buy a real Mac**

At this point in time a real mac is a bit out of my budget, so not an option.

**2. Run Mac OS in a virtual machine**

I actually tried this and although I got everything working very well, without graphics acceleration it is not a pleasure to use at all.

**3. Run a Hackintosh**

Installing Mac OS software on my PC hardware is appealing for many reasons.
First for about half the price of an equivalent Mac I can build a system that
is infinitely expandable.  Second my PC hardware is already compatible.
And third, since most developers use Mac, there is all the software that I
would ever need for development.

**4. Run Bash on Ubuntu on Windows**

This works, with the exception of PostgreSQL not installing correctly (at least at the time of this post).  Still this seemed like a patched together solution.

**5. Dual boot Linux**

I have dual booted Linux many times over the past decade.  Most recently I was running an Arch Linux install.  I learned a lot from that one.  Wine is OK, but every time I use Linux for any length of time I always find myself going back to Windows for one reason or another.

I chose to go with number 3 and installed El Capitan on my PC hardware.  It was definitely a learning experience getting it all set up.  Everything works great with the exception of sleep, which I don't use anyway.

In an upcoming post I will detail the steps that I took to install El Capitan along with the hardware that I am using.
