I know that Rouge is the recommended highlighter for Jekyll, but there currently
is not a lexar for MQL.  Until I get to writing one I am currently using Pygments
to display code blocks with line numbering. Unfortunately using Pygments with line
numbering breaks my Jekyll layout and does not correctly allow for copying and pasting
of code.  Here is how I installed Pygments and how to fix the code block formatting.

### Install Pygments on Mac OS for use in Jekyll

Installing Pygments on the mac is as simple as running the following two commands.
{% highlight ruby linenos %}
def style_with_rouge
  puts 'colorized and numberized!'
end
style_with_rouge
{% endhighlight %}
