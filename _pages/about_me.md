### Why a career change?
For the past 20 plus years I have been working as a bartender on the
Las Vegas strip. I make a good living with great benefits in my current position
but there is very little satisfaction in it. Programming has been a long time hobby
of mine.  I enjoy it very much and feel by solving problems through code I can make
a difference, even if it is just in the user experience.

### What am I doing to make the change?
By reading below you will see that my experience is limited to projects that I wanted
to work on for myself, thus I learned vary specific things for the problems that I
was trying to solve.  Consequently, I always programmed in a procedural manner and
never picked up Object Oriented programming. To remedy this I am currently attending
[Launch School](https://launchschool.com/) to learn fundamentals in a well defined
path. I also practice what I have learned and learn new ways to do things via
[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/).

### Early programming exposure
When I was 10 we got our first computer, a [Radio Shack TRS-80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80).
I quickly became bored with it since it really didn't do much.  A year later we go
a [Commodore Vic 20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_VIC-20) and my life changed.
I remember typing in code from Compute! magazine to run different games and programs.
It was very exciting and I couldn't wait for new issues to arrive in the mail.

Through my middle school years we were taught Basic, along with some Logo and Pascal.
I really enjoyed basic and got pretty good at it. My first job was writing a scheduling
and inventory program in Basic for a restaurant that my dad worked at. It took about
three days and I was paid $20 for it.

### Later experience
I didn't really do much with computers again until I was in my twenties. My roommate
had a computer running windows 3.1 connected to a 14.4k modem. He would dial into
BBSes and chat for hours with various people. I remember using his computer to chat
and play Lemmings and other games. I was hooked again and had to have my own computer
but couldn't afford one at the time. I started researching how to assemble my own
computer and built my own with a Pentium 166mmx around the time Windows 95 came out.
I learned so much throughout the process and to this day still build my own computers.

### My first experinces with web development
In 2001 I started investigating ways to make money online. I set up a few web stores
to sell products online via drop shipping. I used an open source PHP shopping cart
called [osCommerce](https://www.oscommerce.com/) and everytime that I couldn't find
an addon for a feature that I wanted I dove into the code to try and figure it out
on my own. Through customizing these stores I learned a bit of PHP and MySQL and
realized that I enjoyed programming much more than selling.

I spent most of 2002 learning more about PHP/MySQL and in early 2003 I launched
[dropshipsites.com](http://www.dropshipsites.com/), a site to sell turnkey stores
to others. The stores were pre-populated with hundreds of products provided by
drop ship suppliers. The purchaser had the option of hosting with me or elsewhere,
so in addition to the site sales I was making additional income through hosting.
I continued to improve the site and the store script that I was using and in 2003
I made a modification to a review approval system to make it compatible with a newer
version. Not very exciting, but it was my very first open source contribution.

By 2006, dropshipsites was consuming too much of my time (according to the wife),
so I sold all the scripts, customizations and databases. Rather than leaving the
domain empty I took all of information that I had on various drop shippers and turned
the site into a directory.  I wrote a banner rotation script and was making money
from Adsense and banner ads from various affiliate networks. Although, not very
pretty, the site is still online today and makes a little money each month, although
nowhere near what it made in the past when banner ads were the big thing.

In 2009 I created two sites, [buywholesalelots.com](http://www.buywholesalelots.com)
and <a>comparecellphonedeals.com</a>. The latter was a website for comparing deals from cellular
various providers for specific phones, while buywholesalelots was a wholesale site
which aggregated products from eBay, Amazon and other wholesale vendors. Through
these sites I learned about working with APIs, web scraping and dealing with large
databases. Of the two, only buywholesalelots is still online.

### I learned about algorithmic trading and some Python

In 2012 I learned about Forex trading and that you could write programs that would
trade for you 24/7. Over the following month I taught myself MQL4, a C based language
that MetaTrader 4 uses for algorithmic trading programs. Over the last few years I
have written and tested nearly 100 different trading programs and have shared a few
on the forums at forexfactory.com.

In 2015, I learned a little Python because I was writing a program in MQL that traded
on 28 pairs and needed a way to trade smaller size. To solve this problem I wrote
a bridge that takes information from MT4 and opens and closes trades on Oanda's FxTrade
platform via their API. You can view the program on
[GitHub](https://github.com/LonnieCoffman/mt4_to_oanda_fxtrade_bridge) or [ForexFactory](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=8541097#post8541097).

I do not trade all the time, but whenever I come up with a new trading idea code it
up in MQL to test it out.
